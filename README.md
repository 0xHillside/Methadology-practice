# Outline

This is to help document my journey when it comes to practicing my methodology, I have had this issue where I would either give up too quickly on a box due to my Impatience and lack of methodology, when it came to retired boxes I would be to eager to open the writeup and with the active ones I wouldn't even ask for a hint just give up

#### References
I did use Alex's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jccqNN1jOgE) to be quite ones and then make my own sort of additions to it 

So back to where we where this is a going to be split into three parts, 
1. The methodology, 2.
2. the Path's you can take to refurbish / refresh your mind
3. The actual lists of the boxes you will do 

#### productivity

here are some few tips n tricks to work on and do so you can try and be productive
- 5 minute rule
	- sit and start working with a 5 minute timer, if you cant really focus in the first 5 minutes and leave the desk and continue at a later day
- Read Slow to be able to read fast
	- Reading output that's generated slowly and methodically is better than reading like a madman and clearly missing the path for the box
- Always Try it... wont hurt will it?
	- Always try everything, even if its *no way this is too stupid* or even if its *no way its too hard*, you never know it might be the path!
- [Pomodoro](https://pomofocus.io/) technique
	- 50 minutes usually studying and 10 minutes break (my routine)
- If you have a break or if your done
	- Step away from your desk and leave the house, take a walk! smell some fresh air
- Daily and weekly goals
	- In 1 day of the week organize your thoughts to be able to know 
	  what your planning to do in the upcoming week
## Methodology

So here the main goal is setting achievable goals, in Alex's video he recommended doing 1 hour per box but Ill add to it an extension if I feel its necessary. make sure to actually understand everything. what's the technology being used?, how does it work? is it related to this current thing I'm doing?, is there any way I can take advantage of what I already know and what I just learnt?

- Day 1
	- User
		- 1 hour
			- 10 min break
		- 1 hour extension
- Day 2
	- Root
		- 1 hour
			- 10 min break
		- 1 hour extension


Note: you don't need to do the extension right after the 1 hour expires, you can exhaust that 1 hour maybe in the morning and then later on in the night use your extension!

The main idea here is that you get 1 hour to get the user on a box and another hour extension incase you feel very VERY close, after that you are NOT allowed to continue on the box in the cases where you are tired or already used up all your energy, if you were able to get root in 1 hour then you can use the extension of `day 1` to attempt at getting root. 
## Path

Tryhackme's Jr penetration tester -> HackTheBox's Starting Point (Yes all tiers too) -> Into the following lists

Of course you can feel free to skip this and go straight into the lists, it is entirely optional

### Lists

- List 1
	- Lame
	- Active
	- Shocker

	- Netmon
	- Script kiddie
	- Heist

## Game plan?

this would be based on your notes, it can be a mindmap, a checklist on your notes and overtime new things will be added and things WILL get easier and better

- Web checklist
- PrivEsc Checklist
- Enum Checklist
- 10 minute break
- Slow reading
